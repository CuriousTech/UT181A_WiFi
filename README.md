# UT181A_WiFi
Uni-T UT181A WiFi Interface  

Optically isolated interface for the UT181A using the ESP8266 for WiFi in either STA or AP mode. USB Rechargeable 1 cell LiPo and optional OLED display, which should be disabled for speed.  

The code is very rough right now, but should be completed in a short time.  Currently there's a basic web interface and binary WebSocket for a Windows software interface. [WindowsApp](https://www.curioustech.net/ut181a.html)
