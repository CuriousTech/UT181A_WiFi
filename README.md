# UT181A_WiFi
Uni-T UT181A WiFi Interface  

Optically isolated interface for the UT181A using the ESP8266 for WiFi in either STA or AP mode. USB Rechargeable 1 cell LiPo and optional OLED display, which should be disabled for speed.  

The code is mostly complete. The graph needs more work, and update rate needs to be added. There should be more export formats as well. Currently there's a basic web interface and binary WebSocket for a Windows software interface.
