# UT181A_WiFi
Uni-T UT181A WiFi Interface  

Optically isolated interface for the UT181A using the ESP8266 for WiFi in either STA or AP mode. USB Rechargeable 1 cell LiPo and optional OLED display, which should be disabled for speed.  

The code is complete. There should be more export formats though. There's a basic web interface and binary WebSocket for a Windows software interface.
